# What is this?
This is just a set of (Java|Type)Script extensions that I've found useful. Currently this package only publishes the array portion.

# What's included?
Here are some of the functions from the TypeScript definition

* first
* last
* tail
* coalesce
* distinct
* firstOrDefault
* toHashMap
* diff
* diffLeft
* diffRight
